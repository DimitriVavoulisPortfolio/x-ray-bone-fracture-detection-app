# X-Ray Bone Fracture Detection Model

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development and implementation of an advanced machine learning model for detecting bone fractures in X-ray images. The goal is to create a tool that can assist radiologists and emergency room physicians in quickly and accurately identifying fractures, potentially reducing diagnosis time and improving patient care.

## Model Architecture

We utilized YOLOv8l (You Only Look Once, version 8 large) for this project. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection architecture known for its balance of speed and accuracy.

Key features of our implementation:
- Single-stage detector for efficient inference
- CSPDarknet53 backbone with additional layers for feature extraction
- Path Aggregation Network (PAN) for enhanced feature fusion
- Multi-scale predictions for robust detection across various fracture sizes
- Adapted for multi-class fracture detection
- Optimized for medical imaging specifics

Model specifications:
- Parameters: Approximately 43.7 million
- FLOPs: Around 165 billion per forward pass at 640x640 resolution
- Inference speed: Suitable for near real-time applications in clinical settings

## Dataset and Preprocessing

The model was trained on the [Bone Fracture Detection Computer Vision Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/bone-fracture-detection-computer-vision-project) from Kaggle, which includes:
- Over 7,000 X-ray images
- 7 classes of fractures: elbow, fingers, forearm, humerus, shoulder, wrist, and general humerus fractures

Data preprocessing steps:
1. Image normalization
2. Augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, contrast adjustment) to improve model generalization
3. Splitting into train, validation, and test sets (70/15/15 split)

## Training Process

The model was trained for 300 epochs with the following key parameters:
- Learning rate: 0.002 with cosine annealing
- Batch size: 8
- Image size: 512x512
- Optimizer: SGD with momentum (0.937) and weight decay (0.0005)

Training was performed on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU, taking approximately 4.5 hours.

### Training Curves

The training process showed consistent improvement across various metrics:

1. **Box Loss**: Decreased from ~2.5 to ~1.1
2. **Class Loss**: Decreased from ~7.0 to ~1.0
3. **DFL Loss**: Decreased from ~2.2 to ~1.1

Validation metrics also showed improvement, although with more fluctuation:

1. **Validation Box Loss**: Stabilized around 2.8
2. **Validation Class Loss**: Increased gradually to ~4.0
3. **Validation DFL Loss**: Increased to ~2.5

## Model Performance

Our YOLOv8l model achieved promising results on the test set:

- **mAP50 (mean Average Precision at IoU=50)**: 0.371
- **mAP50-95**: 0.180
- **Precision**: 0.462
- **Recall**: 0.260

### Per-Class Performance

Performance varied across fracture types:

1. Elbow positive: mAP50 = 0.0082
2. Fingers positive: mAP50 = 0.167
3. Forearm fracture: mAP50 = 0.153
4. Humerus fracture: mAP50 = 0.674
5. Shoulder fracture: mAP50 = 0.175
6. Wrist positive: mAP50 = 0.413

## Bounding Box Analysis

Analysis of the bounding box predictions revealed:
- Most detections concentrated in the image center (x and y between 0.2 and 0.8)
- Bounding box widths generally smaller (mostly below 0.4)
- Heights showing more variation but typically below 0.6

This distribution aligns with the expected locations and sizes of fractures in standard X-ray images.

## Practical Applications

This model demonstrates potential for several real-world applications:

1. **Triage Assistance**: Quickly prioritize potential fracture cases in busy emergency departments.
2. **Second Opinion Tool**: Provide an automated "second look" to support radiologists' diagnoses.
3. **Rural and Remote Healthcare**: Assist healthcare providers in areas with limited access to specialist radiologists.
4. **Training and Education**: Use as a teaching tool for medical students and residents.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

1. **Class Imbalance**: Addressed using weighted loss functions and strategic augmentation of underrepresented classes.
2. **Small Object Detection**: Implemented multi-scale training and testing to improve detection of small fractures.
3. **False Positives**: Utilized hard negative mining during training to reduce false positive rates.
4. **Overfitting**: Implemented early stopping and learning rate scheduling to prevent overfitting.

## Future Work

To further improve the model for real-world deployment:

1. Expand the dataset with more diverse X-ray images, including various equipment types and patient demographics.
2. Implement explainable AI techniques to provide reasoning for model predictions.
3. Develop a user-friendly interface for clinical settings, including integration with PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems).
4. Conduct extensive clinical validation studies in partnership with radiology departments.
5. Explore ensemble methods or model distillation to improve performance while maintaining inference speed.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Applying state-of-the-art deep learning models to real-world medical problems
- Handling medical imaging data and associated challenges
- Balancing model performance with practical clinical needs
- Understanding the broader context and potential impact of AI in healthcare

The developed YOLOv8l-based model shows promise for enhancing fracture detection workflows, potentially improving patient care through faster and more consistent diagnoses. The combination of technical accuracy and practical applicability makes this project a strong foundation for further research and development in AI-assisted medical imaging.
