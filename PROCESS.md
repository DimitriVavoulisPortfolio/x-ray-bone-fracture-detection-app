# Development Process

## 1. Dataset Preparation and Challenge Resolution

- Started with the Kaggle bone fracture detection dataset.
- Encountered an issue: test set had empty label files.
- Solution: Split the evaluation set into two parts to create a new test set with labels.
- This approach ensured we had proper data for training, validation, and testing.

## 2. Performance Optimization

- Initial training time estimate: 44 days (prohibitively long).
- Implemented several optimizations to dramatically reduce training time:
  - Refined data loading and preprocessing pipeline.
  - Optimized model architecture for the specific task.
  - Utilized efficient data augmentation techniques.
  - Leveraged GPU acceleration effectively.
- Result: Reduced training time from 44 days to a couple of hours.
  - This 500x speedup made the project feasible within a reasonable timeframe.

## 3. Model Development and Iteration

- Chose YOLOv8l as the base model for its balance of speed and accuracy.
- Conducted multiple training runs with different hyperparameters.
- Iterative process of training, evaluation, and refinement:
  - Adjusted learning rates, batch sizes, and augmentation strategies.
  - Fine-tuned model architecture for bone fracture detection task.
  - Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## 4. Error Analysis and Model Improvement

- Performed detailed error analysis after each significant iteration.
- Identified classes with lower performance (e.g., wrist fractures).
- Implemented targeted data augmentation for underperforming classes.
- Refined loss function to balance class performance.

## 5. Application Development

- Developed a user-friendly interface for model interaction.
- Ensured efficient image processing for near real-time inference.
- Implemented clear visualization of detection results.

## 6. Documentation and GitHub Repository Setup

- Created comprehensive README.md and MODEL.md files.
- Documented code with clear comments for maintainability.
- Organized repository structure for easy navigation and understanding.
- Ensured all necessary files and instructions were included for reproducibility.
