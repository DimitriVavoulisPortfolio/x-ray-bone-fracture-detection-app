# X-Ray Bone Fracture Detection App

This is an X-Ray Bone Fracture Detection App to assist medical professionals with the fast-forwarding of the diagnosis process, it runs on the user's device with a YOLOv8l model.

DISCLAIMER: This is a functional prototype

## Model Architecture

The YOLOv8 model used in this project is the YOLOv8l (large) variant, which is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its high accuracy and efficiency.

The model architecture consists of a deep convolutional neural network with multiple layers and skip connections, which allows for the effective extraction and combination of low-level and high-level features for accurate object detection.

## Training and Evaluation

The YOLOv8 model was trained on the provided X-ray bone fracture dataset, which includes images and annotations for various types of bone fractures. The training process optimized the model's parameters to accurately detect and localize the bone fractures in the X-ray images.

During the evaluation phase, the model was tested on a separate test set to assess its performance. The evaluation metrics, including mAP (mean Average Precision), precision, recall, and F1-score, were calculated to measure the model's effectiveness in detecting bone fractures.

## Model Performance

The YOLOv8 model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

- mAP50: 0.37
- mAP50-95: 0.18
- Precision: 0.46
- Recall: 0.26

These metrics suggest that the model is capable of detecting bone fractures with reasonable accuracy, but there is still room for improvement. The project team is continuously working on optimizing the model's performance and exploring strategies to enhance the detection capabilities.

## Usage

To use the YOLOv8 bone fracture detection model in the X-Ray Bone Fracture Detection App, please refer to the instructions in the [README.md](README.md) file. The model's trained weights are available in the project repository and can be used to run the application.

## Future Improvements

The project team is committed to improving the performance of the YOLOv8 bone fracture detection model. Some potential areas for future work include:

- Exploring alternative model architectures or data augmentation techniques to improve the model's accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset with more diverse X-ray images to increase the model's robustness.
- Integrating the model with additional medical imaging analysis tools or clinical workflows.
- Optimizing the model's inference speed for real-time or edge deployment scenarios.

We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community to help enhance the X-Ray Bone Fracture Detection App and the underlying YOLOv8 model.
